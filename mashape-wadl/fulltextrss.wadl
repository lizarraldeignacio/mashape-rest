                        <doc>tell Full Text RSS what it should expect when fetching the input URL By default Full Text RSS tries to guess whether the response is a feed or regular HTML page It s a good idea to be explicit by passing the appropriate type in this parameter This is useful if for example a feed stops working and begins to return HTML or redirecs to a HTML page as a result of site changes In such a scenario if you ve been explicit about the URL being a feed Full Text RSS will not parse HTML returned in response If you pass accept html previously html Full Text RSS will not attempt to parse the response as a feed This increases performance slightly and should be used if you know that the URL is not a feed Note If excluded or set to auto Full Text RSS first tries to parse the server s response as a feed and only if it fails to parse as a feed will it revert to HTML parsing In the default parse as feed first mode Full Text RSS will identify itself as PHP first and only if a valid feed is returned will it identify itself as a browser in subsequent requests to fetch the feed items In parse as html mode Full Text RSS will identify itself as a browser from the very first request</doc>
